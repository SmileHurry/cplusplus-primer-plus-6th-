# cplusplus-primer-plus-6th-

These folders contain discussion questions & programming practice questions of c++ primer plus (the 6th version).
From Chapter 3 ~ Chapter 15.

Each program is written by myself on vs2013, including a little bit diffcult questions.

This is probably the most complete version because when I begin to learn c++ since the middle of last year, I could not find a very complete answer of all practice questions .So I begin to write my own programs of each question.

I really hope it comes in handy for everyone loving c++ and c++ primer plus. Besides, welcome to discuss together if you have any doubt towards the programs or be willing to add the remaining Chapters.
